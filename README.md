# hey guys

## problem 

"Hey guys" is a common salutation, but it's not gender neutral. People who aren't men can feel excluded when addressed as "guys," even if that is not the intent. 

## solution 

Instead of using "hey guys," consider one of these several alternatives: 

- everyone 
- folks 
- friends 
- pals 
- team 
- y'all
