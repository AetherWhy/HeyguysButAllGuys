# hey guys

## Why?

"Hey guys" is a common salutation, but it's not gender neutral. People who aren't men can feel excluded when addressed as "guys," even if that is not the intent.

Instead of using "hey guys," consider one of these several alternatives:

- everyone
- folks
- all
- friends
- team
- y'all
- yinz
- youse
- people
- peeps
