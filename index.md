# hey-guys

## hey guys

### problem

"Hey guys" is a common salutation, but it's not gender neutral. People who aren't men can feel excluded when addressed as "guys," even if that is not the intent.

### solution

Instead of using "hey guys," consider one of these several alternatives:

- everyone
- folks
- friends
- pals
- team
- y'all

### thanks
