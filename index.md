      <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-7 col-sm-6">
        <h1>hey guys</h1>
        <h2>problem</h2>
        <p class="lead">"Hey guys" is a common salutation, but it's not gender neutral. People who aren't men can feel excluded when addressed as "guys," even if that is not the intent.</p>
        <h2>solution</h2>
        <p class="lead">Instead of using "hey guys," consider one of these several alternatives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>everyone</li>
          <li>folks</li>
          <li>friends</li>
          <li>pals</li>
          <li>team</li>
          <li>y'all</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>thanks</h2>
        <p class="lead"><a href="http://sentenc.es/">sentenc.es</a> for the idea for this site.</p>
